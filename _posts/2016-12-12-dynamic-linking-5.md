Okay, I've decided to go with the approach of building `libc.a` with `-fPIC`, then relinking that into `libc.so`. That seems to work!

The precise invocation is

```
$ wasm32-virtual-wasm32-ld -shared -o libc.so --whole-archive -'(' build/wasm32/glibc/libc.a   -')' --no-whole-archive ./wasm32-virtual-wasm32/lib/gcc/wasm32-virtual-wasm32/7.0.0/libgcc.a
$ bash -x ./bin/wasmify-wasm32 ./libc.so > libc.wasm
```

I've experimented a little, and compile time for the wasm binaries is a lot shorter than for their asm.js equivalents. They're obviously a lot smaller, but, surprisingly to me, they're also significantly smaller once compressed with 7zip.

A lot of performance measurements, including with the patch from [bug 1253952][bug 1253952]. That patch appears to have much less of an effect on wasm than it did on asm.js, and I'm not sure whyâ€”the generated code looks right in both cases.

Tried building the build/wasm32/perl.make target from scratch on a VM. It works, if you run `make` targets in the right order.

I think wasm custom sections names should be URIs, except when a short name has been made official. [Tag URIs][tag uri scheme] allow anyone with an email address to mint unique URIs that are explicitly not resolvable, so it's not a restriction.

Thinking about how to interface with synchronous wasm functions. What should Just Work is asm statements, but it would be nice to write something like

```
extern double emscripten_sqrt(double) __attribute__((synccall));
```

and be able to use `emscripten_sqrt` as an ordinary function. Maybe even a function pointer. Hmm.

Some misguided (and since-reverted) changes to the GOT stuff.

`-Os` is broken. [Glibc][glibc] uses magic to force that function to be statically linked in dynamic libraries, and that appears not to work with our semi-shared approach.

`-O2` is significantly faster than `-O3`. Maybe we're running out of icache? Weird, `-O1` is even faster.
